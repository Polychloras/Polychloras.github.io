Key historical events 

1973 - On 11 September, the armed forces stage a coup and depose Salvador Allende. A "Junta Militar" led by General Augusto Pinochet took control of the government. The dictatorship began a violent political persecution of the population. As part of the "Caravana de la muerte", the army deployed its forces throughout the country, killing and forcibly disappearing those perceived as political opponents. 

1976 - Catholic Archbishop Raúl Silva Henríquez founded the Vicaría de la solidaridad. The organisation would provide a wide range of assistance to victims of human rights violations until 1992. 

1978 - Hornos de Lonquén case. The remains of 15 campesinos imprisoned during the early years of the dictatorship are found in the lime kilns of an abandoned mine. This site was one of the first to be transformed into a place of remembrance after the dictatorship. 

1983 - A mass protest against the dictatorship is held in Santiago in May. Mass protests continue in the following years. 

1985 - The discovery of the decapitated bodies of three members of the Communist Party (José Manuel Parada, Manuel Guerrero and Santiago Nattino) causes a nationwide shock. 

1989 - In the context of mass mobilisations against the dictatorship, a referendum is held on the continuation of the Pinochet government. The "Campaña por el No" (a campaign against continuity of the dictatorship government) wins, paving the way for elections. 

1990 - In May, Patricio Aylwin becomes the first elected president since the dictatorship.
