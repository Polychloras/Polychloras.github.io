         1967 : Masacre de San Juan. In June, during the celebration of the night of San Juan, military troops invaded the mining camps of Catavi, killing workers and their families.

         1971 : In a coup d'état, Colonel Hugo Banzer installed himself in the government and overthrew Torres. On 21 August, the day of the coup, violent clashes erupted in the country, and many people were killed in the repression.
         The Banzer dictatorship linked its repressive activities to those of the Condor Plan in Latin America.

         1979 : Masacre de Todos Santos. At the beginning of November, Colonel Alberto Natusch leads a coup d'état. Numerous protests follow, which are violently suppressed by the army.
         1980 : The priest Luis Espinal, who had actively denounced the repression and corruption of the government forces, is tortured and murdered by them.
         1980 : In July, General Luis García Meza and Colonel Luis Arce stage a coup d'état. Violent repression is unleashed against the population. Political leaders Marcelo Quiroga and Carlos Flores were murdered, and their bodies disappeared. Quiroga had promoted a trial to bring Banzer to justice.
