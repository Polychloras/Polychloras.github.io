            1973-1976 : A period of three Peronist administrations during which the country experienced a climate of violence and generalised instability,
            as part of the struggle for power between the different factions of this movement. The end of this period was marked by a series of politically motivated deaths.

            militarised, and systematic political persecution of the population began.
            The number of arrests, murders, cases of torture and abductions of children during this period are considered evidence of
            state terrorism. The exact number of victims is still disputed, but estimates put the number of disappeared prisoners at
            around 30,000.
